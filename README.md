8-Puzzle Solver
This Python application is designed to solve the classic 8-puzzle game using Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A* search algorithms. 
The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a 3x3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and an empty space, allowing tiles to be moved horizontally or vertically 
into the empty space.
